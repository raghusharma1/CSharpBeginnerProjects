   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Input

Details:
  TestName: TestRunWithNullGraphThrowsArgumentNullException
  Description: Verify that the Run method throws an ArgumentNullException when passed a null graph.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Verify that an ArgumentNullException is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing potential null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph

Details:
  TestName: TestRunWithEmptyGraphCompletesWithoutError
  Description: Ensure that the Run method completes successfully when given an empty graph.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that the method completes without throwing any exceptions.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs without errors.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph

Details:
  TestName: TestRunWithSingleVertexGraphProcessesCorrectly
  Description: Check if the Run method correctly processes a graph with a single vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with one vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that the vertex's DFSVertex value has been processed (StartTime and EndTime are set).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly handles the simplest non-empty graph case.

Scenario 4: Connected Graph

Details:
  TestName: TestRunWithConnectedGraphProcessesAllVertices
  Description: Verify that all vertices in a connected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple connected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices have been processed (StartTime and EndTime are set for all).
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method correctly traverses and processes all vertices in a connected graph.

Scenario 5: Disconnected Graph

Details:
  TestName: TestRunWithDisconnectedGraphProcessesAllComponents
  Description: Ensure that all components of a disconnected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple disconnected components.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices in all components have been processed.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles disconnected graphs by processing all components.

Scenario 6: Cyclic Graph

Details:
  TestName: TestRunWithCyclicGraphCompletesWithoutInfiniteLoop
  Description: Check if the Run method correctly processes a graph containing cycles without getting stuck in an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with cycles.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed and the method completes in a reasonable time.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle graphs with cycles without issues.

Scenario 7: Large Graph

Details:
  TestName: TestRunWithLargeGraphCompletesInReasonableTime
  Description: Verify that the Run method can process a large graph within an acceptable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a large UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph and measure execution time.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed and the execution time is within an acceptable range.
Validation:
  This test confirms the method's performance and scalability with larger inputs.

Scenario 8: Graph with Pre-initialized Vertices

Details:
  TestName: TestRunWithPreInitializedVerticesResetsProperly
  Description: Ensure that the Run method correctly resets and processes vertices that were previously initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with vertices having non-default DFSVertex values.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices have been properly reset and processed.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles graphs where vertices might have pre-existing DFSVertex values.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the Run method, including edge cases, different graph structures, and potential issues that might arise during execution.
