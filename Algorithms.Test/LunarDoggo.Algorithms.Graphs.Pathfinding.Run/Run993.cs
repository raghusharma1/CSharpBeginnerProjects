   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Input

Details:
  TestName: ThrowArgumentNullExceptionWhenGraphIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Verify that an ArgumentNullException is thrown with the correct message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing potential null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessEmptyGraphWithoutException
  Description: Ensure that the method can handle an empty graph (a graph with no vertices) without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty IGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that the method completes without throwing an exception.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases such as empty graphs gracefully.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Verify that the method correctly processes a graph with a single vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with one vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Check that the vertex's StartTime and EndTime are set and Processed is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph.

Scenario 4: Connected Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessConnectedGraphCorrectly
  Description: Verify that the method correctly processes a connected graph with multiple vertices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple connected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the connected graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed, have valid StartTime and EndTime values, and form a valid DFS tree structure.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly traverses a connected graph, setting appropriate values for each vertex.

Scenario 5: Disconnected Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessDisconnectedGraphCorrectly
  Description: Verify that the method correctly processes a disconnected graph (multiple components).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple disconnected components.
  Act: Call the Run method with the disconnected graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices in all components are processed, have valid StartTime and EndTime values, and form valid DFS tree structures for each component.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle disconnected graphs, processing all components independently.

Scenario 6: Cyclic Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessCyclicGraphWithoutInfiniteLoop
  Description: Ensure that the method can process a graph containing cycles without entering an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with cycles.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed, have valid StartTime and EndTime values, and the method terminates in a reasonable time.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle graphs with cycles, which is crucial for preventing infinite recursion.

Scenario 7: Large Graph Performance

Details:
  TestName: ProcessLargeGraphInReasonableTime
  Description: Verify that the method can process a large graph within a reasonable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a large IGraph<DFSVertex> (e.g., 10000+ vertices).
  Act: Call the Run method with the large graph and measure execution time.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed and the execution time is within an acceptable range.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method's performance scales well with larger graphs, which is important for real-world applications.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `Run` method, including edge cases, error handling, and different graph structures. They aim to ensure the correctness and robustness of the Depth-First Search implementation.
