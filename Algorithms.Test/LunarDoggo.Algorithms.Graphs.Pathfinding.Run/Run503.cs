   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Handling

Details:
  TestName: ThrowArgumentNullExceptionWhenGraphIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance with no graph.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Expect an ArgumentNullException to be thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessEmptyGraphWithoutException
  Description: Ensure the method can handle an empty graph without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty IGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that no exception is thrown and the method completes successfully.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs gracefully.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Verify that a graph with a single vertex is processed correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with one vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Check that the vertex's StartTime and EndTime are set and Processed is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph.

Scenario 4: Multiple Disconnected Vertices Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessMultipleDisconnectedVerticesCorrectly
  Description: Ensure that a graph with multiple disconnected vertices is processed correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple disconnected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices have been processed (Processed is true, StartTime and EndTime are set).
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles graphs with no edges, processing all vertices independently.

Scenario 5: Connected Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessConnectedGraphCorrectly
  Description: Verify that a connected graph is processed in the correct order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with connected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the connected graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed and that the StartTime and EndTime values reflect the correct DFS order.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the depth-first search algorithm is correctly implemented for a typical connected graph.

Scenario 6: Cyclic Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessCyclicGraphWithoutInfiniteLoop
  Description: Ensure that a graph with cycles is processed without getting stuck in an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with cycles.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed and the method completes in a reasonable time.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can handle graphs with cycles, which is crucial for the correctness of the DFS algorithm.

Scenario 7: Large Graph Performance

Details:
  TestName: ProcessLargeGraphWithinReasonableTime
  Description: Verify that the method can process a large graph within an acceptable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a large IGraph<DFSVertex> with many vertices and edges.
  Act: Call the Run method with the large graph and measure the execution time.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed and the execution time is within an acceptable range.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method's performance is reasonable for larger graphs, which is important for scalability.

Scenario 8: Preservation of Graph Structure

Details:
  TestName: PreserveGraphStructureAfterProcessing
  Description: Ensure that the original graph structure remains unchanged after processing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a known structure.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that the graph's structure (vertices and edges) remains the same as before processing.
Validation:
  This test checks that the DFS algorithm doesn't modify the underlying graph structure, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `Run` method, including edge cases, error handling, and typical use cases. They aim to ensure the correctness, robustness, and performance of the Depth-First Search implementation.
