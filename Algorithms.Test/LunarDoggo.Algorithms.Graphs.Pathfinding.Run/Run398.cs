   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Input

Details:
  TestName: ThrowsArgumentNullExceptionForNullGraph
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Verify that an ArgumentNullException is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing potential null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph

Details:
  TestName: RunsSuccessfullyOnEmptyGraph
  Description: Ensure the method executes without errors when given an empty graph.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that the method completes without throwing any exceptions.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs without crashing or entering infinite loops.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Check if the method correctly processes a graph with only one vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with one vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Verify that the vertex's StartTime and EndTime are set and Processed is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph structure.

Scenario 4: Connected Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesConnectedGraphCorrectly
  Description: Verify that all vertices in a connected graph are processed in the correct order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple connected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the connected graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed, have valid StartTime and EndTime values, and form a valid DFS tree structure.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the DFS algorithm works correctly for a typical connected graph scenario.

Scenario 5: Disconnected Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesDisconnectedGraphComponents
  Description: Ensure that all components of a disconnected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple disconnected components.
  Act: Call the Run method with the disconnected graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices in all components are processed and have valid StartTime and EndTime values.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles graphs with multiple disconnected components, ensuring no vertices are left unprocessed.

Scenario 6: Graph With Cycles

Details:
  TestName: HandlesGraphWithCyclesCorrectly
  Description: Check if the method correctly processes a graph containing cycles without entering an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with cycles.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed exactly once and have valid StartTime and EndTime values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the DFS algorithm can handle graphs with cycles without getting stuck or processing vertices multiple times.

Scenario 7: Large Graph Performance

Details:
  TestName: CompletesLargeGraphTraversalInReasonableTime
  Description: Verify that the method can process a large graph within an acceptable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a large UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> (e.g., 10000+ vertices).
  Act: Measure the time taken to call and complete the Run method with the large graph.
  Assert: Check that the execution time is within an acceptable range and all vertices are processed.
Validation:
  This test assesses the performance characteristics of the DFS implementation for large-scale graphs.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `Run` method, including error handling, edge cases, and different graph structures. They aim to ensure the correctness and robustness of the Depth-First Search implementation.
