   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Handling

Details:
  TestName: ThrowArgumentNullExceptionWhenGraphIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Expect an ArgumentNullException to be thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessEmptyGraphWithoutException
  Description: Ensure the method can handle an empty graph without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty IGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that no exception is thrown and the method completes successfully.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs gracefully.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Check if the method correctly processes a graph with a single vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with one vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Verify that the vertex's StartTime and EndTime are set and Processed is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph.

Scenario 4: Connected Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessConnectedGraphCorrectly
  Description: Verify that all vertices in a connected graph are processed in the correct order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple connected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the connected graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed, have valid StartTime and EndTime, and form a valid DFS tree.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the DFS algorithm works correctly for a typical connected graph scenario.

Scenario 5: Disconnected Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessDisconnectedGraphCorrectly
  Description: Ensure that all components of a disconnected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple disconnected components.
  Act: Call the Run method with the disconnected graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices in all components are processed and have valid times.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles graphs with multiple disconnected components.

Scenario 6: Cyclic Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessCyclicGraphWithoutInfiniteLoop
  Description: Check if the method can process a graph containing cycles without getting stuck in an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with cycles.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Confirm that all vertices are processed and the method terminates.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the DFS algorithm correctly handles cycles in the graph.

Scenario 7: Large Graph Performance

Details:
  TestName: ProcessLargeGraphWithinReasonableTime
  Description: Verify that the method can process a large graph within a reasonable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a large IGraph<DFSVertex> with many vertices and edges.
  Act: Call the Run method with the large graph and measure execution time.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed and the execution time is within acceptable limits.
Validation:
  This test assesses the performance characteristics of the DFS implementation for large datasets.

Scenario 8: Preservation of Existing Vertex Data

Details:
  TestName: PreserveExistingVertexDataDuringProcessing
  Description: Ensure that any existing data in DFSVertex objects is not overwritten, except for DFS-specific fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with pre-populated vertex data.
  Act: Call the Run method on the graph.
  Assert: Verify that non-DFS related data in vertices remains unchanged after processing.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the DFS algorithm doesn't inadvertently modify unrelated vertex data.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the DepthFirstSearch.Run method, including edge cases, error handling, and different graph structures. They aim to ensure the correctness and robustness of the DFS implementation.
