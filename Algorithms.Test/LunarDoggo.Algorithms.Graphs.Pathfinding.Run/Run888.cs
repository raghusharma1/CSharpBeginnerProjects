   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Input

Details:
  TestName: ThrowArgumentNullExceptionWhenGraphIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Expect an ArgumentNullException to be thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing potential null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph

Details:
  TestName: RunSuccessfullyOnEmptyGraph
  Description: Ensure the method can handle an empty graph without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that no exception is thrown and the method completes successfully.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs without errors.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Check if the method correctly processes a graph with only one vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with one vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Verify that the vertex's StartTime and EndTime are set and Processed is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph.

Scenario 4: Connected Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessAllVerticesInConnectedGraph
  Description: Verify that all vertices in a connected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple connected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the connected graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices have been processed (Processed is true, StartTime and EndTime are set).
Validation:
  This test confirms that the DFS algorithm visits all vertices in a connected graph.

Scenario 5: Disconnected Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessAllComponentsInDisconnectedGraph
  Description: Ensure that all components of a disconnected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple disconnected components.
  Act: Call the Run method with the disconnected graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices in all components have been processed.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles disconnected graphs by processing all components.

Scenario 6: Cyclic Graph

Details:
  TestName: HandleCyclicGraphWithoutInfiniteLoop
  Description: Check if the method can process a graph containing cycles without getting stuck in an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with cycles.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Confirm that all vertices are processed and the method terminates.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the DFS algorithm can handle cycles in the graph without issues.

Scenario 7: Pre-initialized Vertices

Details:
  TestName: ReinitializePreProcessedVertices
  Description: Verify that the method correctly reinitializes vertices that were previously processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex>. Set some vertices as already processed.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices have been reinitialized and processed correctly.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method properly handles graphs where vertices might have residual state from previous operations.

Scenario 8: Large Graph Performance

Details:
  TestName: ProcessLargeGraphWithinReasonableTime
  Description: Ensure the method can handle a large graph within a reasonable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a large UndirectedUnweightedGraph<DFSVertex> with many vertices and edges.
  Act: Call the Run method with the large graph and measure execution time.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed and the execution time is within acceptable limits.
Validation:
  This test checks the performance characteristics of the DFS implementation for large inputs.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `Run` method, including error handling, edge cases, and different graph structures. They aim to ensure the correctness and robustness of the Depth-First Search implementation.
