   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Handling

Details:
  TestName: ThrowsArgumentNullExceptionWhenGraphIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Expect an ArgumentNullException to be thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesEmptyGraphWithoutErrors
  Description: Ensure the method can handle an empty graph without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty IGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that no exception is thrown and the method completes successfully.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs gracefully.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Check if the method correctly processes a graph with a single vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with one vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Verify that the vertex is marked as processed and has valid start and end times.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph.

Scenario 4: Multiple Disconnected Vertices Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesDisconnectedVerticesCorrectly
  Description: Verify that the method correctly handles a graph with multiple disconnected vertices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple disconnected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed, have unique start and end times, and no predecessors.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle graphs with no edges, processing each vertex independently.

Scenario 5: Simple Connected Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesSimpleConnectedGraphCorrectly
  Description: Ensure the method correctly processes a simple connected graph.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a few connected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed, have correct start and end times, and appropriate predecessors.
Validation:
  This test checks the core functionality of the depth-first search algorithm on a basic connected graph.

Scenario 6: Cyclic Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesCyclicGraphWithoutInfiniteLoop
  Description: Check if the method can handle a graph with cycles without getting stuck in an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a cycle.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed exactly once and have valid start and end times.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle graphs with cycles, a common edge case in graph algorithms.

Scenario 7: Large Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessesLargeGraphEfficiently
  Description: Verify that the method can handle a large graph within a reasonable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a large IGraph<DFSVertex> with many vertices and edges.
  Act: Call the Run method with the large graph, measuring execution time.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed and the execution time is within acceptable limits.
Validation:
  This test assesses the performance and scalability of the method for larger inputs.

Scenario 8: Graph With Pre-initialized Vertices

Details:
  TestName: HandlesGraphWithPreInitializedVerticesCorrectly
  Description: Ensure the method correctly reinitializes and processes a graph where vertices already have DFSVertex values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with vertices that have pre-set DFSVertex values.
  Act: Call the Run method with this graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are reinitialized and processed correctly, overwriting any previous values.
Validation:
  This test checks that the method properly handles graphs where vertices might have existing DFSVertex data, ensuring a clean slate for processing.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `Run` method, including edge cases, error handling, and different graph structures. They aim to ensure the correctness and robustness of the depth-first search implementation.
