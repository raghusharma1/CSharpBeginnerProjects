   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Input

Details:
  TestName: ThrowArgumentNullExceptionWhenGraphIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance with no graph.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Expect an ArgumentNullException to be thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing potential null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessEmptyGraphWithoutException
  Description: Ensure the method can handle an empty graph without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty IGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that no exception is thrown and the method completes successfully.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs gracefully.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Check if the method correctly processes a graph with only one vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a single vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Verify that the vertex is marked as processed and has valid start and end times.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph.

Scenario 4: Connected Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessAllVerticesInConnectedGraph
  Description: Verify that all vertices in a connected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a connected IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the connected graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are marked as processed and have valid start and end times.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method correctly traverses all vertices in a connected graph.

Scenario 5: Disconnected Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessAllComponentsInDisconnectedGraph
  Description: Ensure that all components of a disconnected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a disconnected IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple components.
  Act: Call the Run method with the disconnected graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices across all components are processed and have valid start and end times.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can handle disconnected graphs and process all components independently.

Scenario 6: Correct Time Assignment

Details:
  TestName: AssignCorrectStartAndEndTimes
  Description: Check if start and end times are assigned correctly to vertices during traversal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a known structure.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that the start and end times for each vertex are consistent with DFS traversal order.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the time assignment logic in the DFS algorithm is working correctly.

Scenario 7: Predecessor Assignment

Details:
  TestName: AssignCorrectPredecessors
  Description: Verify that predecessors are correctly assigned during graph traversal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a known structure.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Check that each vertex (except the start vertex) has a correct predecessor assigned.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the predecessor assignment, which is crucial for path reconstruction, is working as expected.

Scenario 8: Cyclic Graph Handling

Details:
  TestName: ProcessCyclicGraphWithoutInfiniteLoop
  Description: Ensure that the method can process a graph containing cycles without entering an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> containing at least one cycle.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed and the method terminates.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can handle graphs with cycles, which is important for robustness in real-world scenarios.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `Run` method, including edge cases, error handling, and core functionality. They should provide a comprehensive test suite for the Depth-First Search implementation.
