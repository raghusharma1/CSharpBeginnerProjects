   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Input

Details:
  TestName: ThrowArgumentNullExceptionWhenGraphIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Expect an ArgumentNullException to be thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing potential null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph

Details:
  TestName: RunSuccessfullyOnEmptyGraph
  Description: Ensure the method can handle an empty graph without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty IGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that the method completes without throwing any exceptions.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs without failing.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Check if the method correctly processes a graph with only one vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a single vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Verify that the vertex's StartTime and EndTime are set and Processed is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph.

Scenario 4: Connected Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessAllVerticesInConnectedGraph
  Description: Verify that all vertices in a connected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a connected IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the connected graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices have been processed (Processed is true for all vertices).
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method correctly traverses all vertices in a connected graph.

Scenario 5: Disconnected Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessAllComponentsInDisconnectedGraph
  Description: Ensure that all components of a disconnected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a disconnected IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple components.
  Act: Call the Run method with the disconnected graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices in all components have been processed.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can handle disconnected graphs and process all components.

Scenario 6: Cyclic Graph

Details:
  TestName: HandleCyclicGraphWithoutInfiniteLoop
  Description: Check if the method can process a graph containing cycles without getting stuck in an infinite loop.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> containing at least one cycle.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed and the method terminates.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle graphs with cycles without issues.

Scenario 7: Large Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessLargeGraphEfficiently
  Description: Verify that the method can handle a large graph within a reasonable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and a large IGraph<DFSVertex> with many vertices and edges.
  Act: Call the Run method with the large graph, measuring execution time.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are processed and the execution time is within acceptable limits.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method scales well for larger graphs and performs efficiently.

Scenario 8: Correct Start and End Times

Details:
  TestName: AssignCorrectStartAndEndTimesToVertices
  Description: Ensure that the StartTime and EndTime for each vertex are assigned correctly and in the right order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a known structure.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that for each vertex, StartTime < EndTime, and that the times are consistent with the DFS order.
Validation:
  This test checks the correctness of the core DFS algorithm implementation.

Scenario 9: Proper Predecessor Assignment

Details:
  TestName: AssignCorrectPredecessorsToVertices
  Description: Verify that each vertex (except the starting vertices of each component) has a correct predecessor assigned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a known structure.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Check that each processed vertex (except starting vertices) has a non-null predecessor that is also processed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the predecessor relationships are correctly established during the DFS traversal.

Scenario 10: Consistency Across Multiple Runs

Details:
  TestName: ProduceConsistentResultsAcrossMultipleRuns
  Description: Check if multiple runs of the algorithm on the same graph produce consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method twice on the same graph.
  Assert: Verify that the processing order, start times, end times, and predecessors are the same for both runs.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the algorithm is deterministic and produces consistent results.
