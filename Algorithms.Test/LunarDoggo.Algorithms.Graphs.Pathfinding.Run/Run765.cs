   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Based on the provided method and related code, here are several test scenarios for the `Run` method of the `DepthFirstSearch` class:

Scenario 1: Null Graph Input

Details:
  TestName: ThrowArgumentNullExceptionWhenGraphIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method throws an ArgumentNullException when a null graph is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance with no graph.
  Act: Call the Run method with a null graph.
  Assert: Expect an ArgumentNullException to be thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles null input, preventing potential null reference exceptions later in the execution.

Scenario 2: Empty Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessEmptyGraphWithoutException
  Description: Ensure the method can handle an empty graph without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an empty IGraph<DFSVertex>.
  Act: Call the Run method with the empty graph.
  Assert: Verify that no exception is thrown and the method completes successfully.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle edge cases like empty graphs without errors.

Scenario 3: Single Vertex Graph

Details:
  TestName: ProcessSingleVertexGraphCorrectly
  Description: Check if the method correctly processes a graph with only one vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a single vertex.
  Act: Call the Run method with the single-vertex graph.
  Assert: Verify that the vertex is marked as processed and has valid start and end times.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality works for the simplest possible graph.

Scenario 4: Connected Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessAllVerticesInConnectedGraph
  Description: Verify that all vertices in a connected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple connected vertices.
  Act: Call the Run method with the connected graph.
  Assert: Check that all vertices are marked as processed and have valid start and end times.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method correctly traverses all vertices in a connected graph.

Scenario 5: Disconnected Graph Processing

Details:
  TestName: ProcessAllComponentsInDisconnectedGraph
  Description: Ensure that all components of a disconnected graph are processed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with multiple disconnected components.
  Act: Call the Run method with the disconnected graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices across all components are processed and have valid start and end times.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can handle disconnected graphs and process all components independently.

Scenario 6: Correct Time Assignment

Details:
  TestName: AssignCorrectStartAndEndTimes
  Description: Check if the start and end times are assigned correctly for each vertex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a known structure.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Verify that the start and end times for each vertex are consistent with DFS order and nesting.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the time assignment logic in the DFS algorithm is working correctly.

Scenario 7: Predecessor Assignment

Details:
  TestName: AssignCorrectPredecessors
  Description: Verify that predecessors are correctly assigned during the DFS traversal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with a known structure.
  Act: Call the Run method with the graph.
  Assert: Check that the predecessor of each vertex (except the start vertex) is correctly set according to the DFS traversal order.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the predecessor assignment, which is crucial for path reconstruction, is working as expected.

Scenario 8: Graph With Cycles

Details:
  TestName: HandleGraphWithCyclesCorrectly
  Description: Ensure that the method correctly processes a graph containing cycles.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DepthFirstSearch instance and an IGraph<DFSVertex> with cycles.
  Act: Call the Run method with the cyclic graph.
  Assert: Verify that all vertices are processed, have correct start and end times, and the presence of cycles doesn't cause infinite loops.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can handle graphs with cycles without getting stuck in infinite recursion.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `Run` method, including edge cases, different graph structures, and key functionalities of the Depth-First Search algorithm.
